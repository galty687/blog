              <p>This article will talk about my thinking on self-publishing (5 minuites reading).</p>
<h2>Reasons</h2>
<p>I have this idea to publish my own books for quite a long time. Several publishers also come to discuss with me about publishing a series of books. However, I am easily distracted by my work. As required by PKU, I need to teach several courses. At the same time, I also need to do researches and supvise students.</p>
<p>I am frequent blogger on Sina Blog where I normal write down every tips and tricks concluded from work. However, I know deep in mind that blogging is quite different from writing a book. When it comes to blogging, you only write for a few readers, so you could write whatever to write. There is no gurantee the article is useful or easy to understand.</p>
<p>When it come to writing a book. You need to make a full plan for everything, like the organization of the book, the tools used to write the book and the publisher to publish. There is too much work to be done before you start to write your own book.</p>
<h2>Self-publishing</h2>
<p>One idea comes to my mind that whether there is a platform where I just could focus on writing. The rest of the writing could be handled by the platform. It's not easy to find such a platform. I did goolge search for this kind of platfrom. Unfortunately, I didn't find one for past few years. </p>
<p>I did find some self-publishing vendors like <a href="http://www.lulu.com">lulu</a> as well as Apple iBooks and Amazon publishing. However, they are all resellers. You need to have a book and sell on their platforms, which means you need to go through all the process before you could publish.</p>
<h2>leanpub</h2>
<p>I happened to find the self-publishing leanpub when I am doing researches about <a href="http://www.gitbook.com">gitbook</a>. I did a quick research and realise it's the platform I am searching for. The platform takes care of almost everything. All you need to do is write your book. Only one thing hinders me for a while. It charges $99 for each book. It's quite some money for me. I am not sure when my book could be completed or how many books could be sold when I completed my book. Although you are not sure, but the platform is sure to charge. </p>
<p>The platform offers a refund within 45 days. I decided to give it try. Hope I could finish my book within 45 days. If the book sells well, the commison fee is defenitely worthwhile. Otherwise, I still have time to withdraw my money back.</p>
